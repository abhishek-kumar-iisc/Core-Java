1. Build an Auction system where there are four item to be sold.

There are 4 bidders bidding for the Items

Item : 
		id - long
		name - String
		basePrice - double
		desc - String

Bidder :
		id - long
		name = String
	
Items
      Car -> 1, "Swift-Dezire", 5_00_000, "good condition car"
      TV  -> 2, "Sony-Bravia", 10_000, "in excellent condition"
      Bike ->3, "Bajaj- Pulsar", 30_000, "run for 20000 Kms"
      laptop -> 4, "Macbook-Pro", 50000, "one year old laptop. Sparingly used"

Bidder :
	  Vinay -> 1, Vinay 
      Krishna -> 2, Krishna 
      Mohan -> 3, Mohan 
      Rohan -> 4, Rohan 
 
 There is an auction class, which takes each items from a set and puts on auction.
 All bidders, will provide their price and after all the bidders have completed bidding,
 the auction class will decide the bidder.
 
 Then the Auction will continue to the next item till all items are bid.
 
 Sample Output:
 
 =============Swift Dezire for Sale, Base Price - 5_00_000================
 
 (All four bidders will be processing input in 4 threads waiting for inputs)

    Bidder1 - Vinay
    ===============Please enter your bid price, Base price - 5_00_000 ==========
    wait for input using scanner 
    
    Bidder2 -Krishna
    ===============Please enter your bid price, Base price - 5_00_000 ==========
    wait for input using scanner 
    
    Bidder3 - Mohan
    ===============Please enter your bid price, Base price - 5_00_000 ==========
    wait for input using scanner 
    
    Bidder4 - Rohan
    ===============Please enter your bid price, Base price - 5_00_000 ==========
    wait for input using scanner 

    (After the input is accepted, reduce the countdown latch)

    After the latch is zero, then announce the winner 

    ============Swift Dezire sold to Mohan - 600000=================== 

    Move on to the next item and continue till all items are exhausted 

    (hint - Make use of CountdownLatch with number of bidders )
